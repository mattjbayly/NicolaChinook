These early migrant Chinook are known to utilize the upper portions of Spius Creek and the Coldwater River. Early migrant Chinook are known to travel upstream through the Nicola mainstem ahead of the thermal barriers in May and June on the falling limb of the freshet. These adults will then hold in deep-water pools within these tributaries until mid-to-late August for spawning (Mazany-Wright et al 2022 citing pers. comm from R.
