    "text": "Overview\nStream temperature becomes too warm for Chinook Salmon at certain life stages. Warming temperatures can have a negative impact on egg survival, alevin/fry survival, and can increase the probability of pre-spawning mortality when mature individuals return to freshwater. High stream temperatures also create thermal barriers between mainstem and tributary sections, blocking the seasonal movement of Chinook. Numerous natural and anthropogenic factors influence stream temperature. Forest harvesting has been demonstrated to have an important influence on stream temperature, in addition to continued changes in climate (Gomi et al., 2006)."

It has a strong control on other fish habitat characteristics including temperature, sedimentation, stream morphology and dissolved oxygen. Continued changes in climate will generally favor an earlier spring freshet, and extended periods of low flow through the late summer and fall. Increasing demand (i.e., withdrawls), forestry, and urban development can further alter the hydrology of the Nicola Basin (i.e., magnitude of peak flow, timing of flow; e.g.,Winkler et al., 2017).\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
