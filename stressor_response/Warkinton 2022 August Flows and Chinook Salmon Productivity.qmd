![(Warkinton et al 2011) Effect of mean August flow during rearing on recruitment of Nicola River Chinook salmon. The three shaded regions represent 90% credible intervals of model predictions based on three spawner abundances (mean, 25th percentile and 75th percentile). The dotted horizontal line shows the replacement level of one recruit per spawner at mean spawner abundance. The vertical dashed grey line indicates the model-predicted value of 10.6 m3sâˆ’1 flow during the rearing summer that results in replacement (recruits/spawner = 1). Rugplots (grey ticks along inside of x and y axes) show distribution of observations.](/stressor_response/images/Screenshot%202023-07-12%20153453.png){fig-align="center"}
