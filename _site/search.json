    "text": "Overview\nStream temperature becomes too warm for Chinook Salmon at certain life stages. Warming temperatures can have a negative impact on egg survival, alevin/fry survival, and can increase the probability of pre-spawning mortality when mature individuals return to freshwater. High stream temperatures also create thermal barriers between mainstem and tributary sections, blocking the seasonal movement of Chinook.\nLandscape activities and exacerbating factors: Numerous natural and anthropogenic factors influence stream temperature. Forest harvesting has been demonstrated to have an important influence on stream temperature, in addition to continued changes in climate (Gomi et al., 2006)."

    "text": "Overview\nStream flow is a state variable in lotic systems. It has a strong control on fish habitat characteristics including temperature, sedimentation, stream morphology and dissolved oxygen. Continued changes in climate will generally favor an earlier spring freshet, and extended periods of low flow through the late summer and fall. Increasing demand (i.e., withdrawls), forestry, and urban development can further alter the hydrology of the Nicola Basin (i.e., magnitude of peak flow, timing of flow; e.g.,Winkler et al., 2017).\nLandscape activities and exacerbating factors: Low flows are governed by climate and watershed attributes. Low flows coincide with high stream temperatures in the August/September period. Exacerbating factors include water withdrawals for agriculture, shifts in landcover (elevated evapotranspiration) as well as changes to the channel morphology and corresponding fish passage issues."

Early migrant Chinook are known to travel upstream through the Nicola mainstem ahead of the thermal barriers in May and June on the falling limb of the freshet. These adults will then hold in deep-water pools within these tributaries until mid-to-late August for spawning (Mazany-Wright et al 2022 citing pers. comm from R. Bailey and Nooaitch Band)."
