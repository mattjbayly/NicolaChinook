It has a strong control on other fish habitat characteristics including temperature, sedimentation, stream morphology and dissolved oxygen. Continued changes in climate will generally favor an earlier spring freshet, and extended periods of low flow through the late summer and fall. Increasing demand (i.e., withdrawls), forestry, and urban development can further alter the hydrology of the Nicola Basin (i.e., magnitude of peak flow, timing of flow; e.g.,Winkler et al., 2017).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
